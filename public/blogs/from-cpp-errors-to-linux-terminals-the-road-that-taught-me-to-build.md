## How It Started

Back in school, we had basic HTML and CSS in our computer class. I didn’t take it too seriously—just messed around with colors and layouts. Coding never felt like my thing. I was more into PT sessions than classrooms, and anything “techie” felt too nerdy to be interesting.

Now, looking back, I see it differently. Tech isn’t just about syntax or screens—it’s actually creative, expressive, and kind of satisfying.

## Enter C++

After the PCM grind in HSC, I found my way to C++ through YouTube tutorials. No UI, no instant results—just dry syntax and endless errors. Segmentation faults, pointers, debugging black holes. It felt more like a chore than a skill.

Eventually, I took a break. I was burnt out, confused, and honestly, just done with trying to understand it.

## College Changed the Game

Getting into Computer Engineering shifted my mindset. Suddenly, I wasn’t just learning to pass exams—I was learning how systems work, how software is built. Every subject cracked open a different layer of how tech operates.

It stopped being about writing random code snippets. I started building actual logic, solving real problems, and understanding how everything connects.

## C++ Came Back

In my first year, C++ made its comeback—this time as a core subject. No more tutorials; this time it was assignments, vivas, and internal marks.

It was tough. But something clicked. Maybe it was the repetition or just getting used to the grind. I started understanding pointers. Classes made sense. I wasn’t perfect, but I was finally getting it.

Still, it didn’t feel creative. It was all logic, no visuals. I could solve problems, but I didn’t feel like I was *building* something tangible.

That’s when I discovered **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Discovering Web Dev

Everything changed with one command:

```bash
npx create-next-app
```

Suddenly, my code came to life—in color, on screen, in real time. Tailwind CSS felt like styling with logic. Next.js made full-stack development feel approachable. I could route pages, hit APIs, and create components all in one project.

I started building real stuff—personal websites, landing pages, shop platforms. Not assignments—actual usable things.

Web dev gave me what C++ didn’t: visual feedback, creativity, and flow. I could code for hours without even realizing time had passed. That’s when I truly felt like a builder, not just a coder.

## My Linux Journey

Linux became my go-to OS for development due to its flexibility, control, and customization options. I started with **Garuda Linux**, an Arch-based distro that combined performance with ease of use. Its rolling release model kept me up to date with the latest software, and its pre-configured setup allowed me to focus on coding rather than configuration.

A key part of my workflow has been **Fish shell**, which offers features like auto-suggestions and syntax highlighting, making my terminal experience smoother. Soon, I plan to shift to Arch Linux for even more control and customization. The idea of building my system from the ground up excites me, and I’m looking forward to exploring the Arch community and deeper **FOSS** contributions.

FOSS and Libre software have been central to my journey—empowering me to modify, distribute, and improve tools I use every day. Whether it’s setting up Docker containers or configuring Nginx, Linux has become a powerful platform for experimenting, troubleshooting, and optimizing my development process.

## The ML Phase: Python, OpenCV & AI

While I was deep into web dev, Python quietly became part of the picture. Clean, readable, and surprisingly fun to use.

I started with basic automation and scripts, then stumbled into **machine learning**. And it blew my mind. Suddenly, code wasn’t just doing what I told it to—it was learning patterns, making predictions. It felt futuristic.

With **OpenCV**, I watched code process visual data—detecting faces, tracking movement, recognizing gestures. I went from styling buttons to understanding how machines “see.” It was a leap, and I was hooked.

This journey culminated in two machine learning projects hosted on my GitHub:    

1. **Auto-Selfie**: A Python-based OpenCV project that automatically captures selfies when a smiling face is detected. Using Haar cascades for face and smile detection, it provides a fun, hands-free way to take pictures. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/sid-lakhani/auto-selfie)

2. **FER-ML**: An emotion detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification. It utilizes the FER-2013 dataset for training and OpenCV for real-time face and emotion detection. The detected emotions are classified into seven categories and displayed in real-time.

## Freelancing Journey

Around this time, I started freelancing and took on **Label Jui Lakhani** as my first client. I built a custom website for them, focusing on creating a user-friendly design while integrating backend logic for better functionality. This project was my first real-world experience outside of personal projects and assignments, and it gave me valuable insights into client communication and project management.

## Where I Am Now

From those early C++ struggles to deploying full-stack apps, working with Linux terminals, and building ML projects—it’s been a wild ride.

1. Web development gave me creativity.
2. Linux gave me power and control.
3. Python brought simplicity and flexibility.
4. Machine learning opened my mind to what’s possible.

And that’s when I realized—this isn’t just a skillset. It’s a space I belong in.

## Final Thoughts

It wasn’t a straight path. It was full of detours, errors, confusion, and pivots. But every step taught me something valuable: how to build, how to learn, and how to push through when nothing’s working.

That’s what being a developer is about—not knowing everything, but being willing to figure it out.
